## Introduction

Pawfect Pups is a fictional dog training company made for educational purposes as the first portfolio project for my diploma in software development that i am studying with the code intitute. This website is aimed at dog owners who would like to find a local dog training company.

While designing this website i took into account the real world demands that customers would have for a real dog training company. I have created static website with a total of six pages that are responsive and contain relevant and useful information to reach these goals.

I have applied the the technologies i have learnt so far and used HTML5 and CSS3 to create my website. Other technologies used are listed in the technologies used section further down the page.

### Devolpment Planes

Whilst planning the website the site owner will use the five development planes as a staple to accommodate to the user goals that are written above. These planes will be used to meet user demands and expectancies.

#### Strategy 

The website will be targeted at the following audience:

* New dog owners.
* Experienced dog owners.
* Dog owners training for competitions.
* People interested in dog training.
* People with dogs of any age.
* People with dogs of any breed.

The website needs to enable the user to:

* Navigate the site with ease.
* Easily find information about the company.
* Easily find contact information.
* Easily find the booking page.
* Have a clear understanding of the booking process.

The website needs to enable the site owner to:

* Easily gather information about customers through the booking form.
* Provide clear information about the company.
* Provide clear contact details.
* Provide clear location details.

#### Scope

While developing the scope plane we decide what requirements our website will need in regards to the user needs defined in the strategy plane and user stories.

The required content of the website will need to include the following:

* Information about the business.
* Information on the classes they offer.
* Information on the trainers.
* Pictures of the training being undertaken.
* Contact information.
* The address.
* A live google map with the exact location.
* A booking page with a form to submit.
* A guide to the booking process.

The required functions of the website will need to include the following:

* A fully responsive website made with a mobile first approach.
* A responsive nav bar which will change dependant on screen size for accessibility ease on different screen sizes.
* A booking form.
* A page for after the form is completed with a 'back to home' button for easy navigation.
* An iframe of google maps.

#### Structure 

While developing the structure plane i decided that the best way to present this information would be in a hierarchical tree structure. This is because i feel it is a easy to navigate structure that is commonly found and the user will be used to using throughout other websites.

#### Skeleton

While developing the skeleton plane i created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

I created the wireframes with a mobile first approach and designed wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop to ensure that the site will be fully responsive upon completion.
