## Introduction

Pawfect Pups is a fictional dog training company made for educational purposes as the first portfolio project for my diploma in software development that i am studying with the code intitute. This website is aimed at dog owners who would like to find a local dog training company. 

While designing this website i took into account the real world demands that customers would have for a real dog training company. I have created static website with a total of six pages that are responsive and contain relevant and useful information to reach these goals. 

I have applied the the technologies i have learnt so far and used HTML5 and CSS3 to create my website. Other technologies used are listed in the technologies used section further down the page.
